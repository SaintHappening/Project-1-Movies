Readme for Project 1:  Movie Page.

Step 1:  Make sure that all of these files go into the same folder.  The program will not run without everything being together.

Step 2:  Navigate to the folder where you have saved everything, and clone the repository.  You can do this by typing the following:  git clone "https://github.com/SaintHappening/Project-1-Movies into Terminal.

Step 3:  Open the file Entertainment Center.py and press Cmd + B, to build the program.  This should open up a browser window on your computer, which will allow you to see and interact with the movie file.

Problems, or for help, please either log an issue on Github, or email me through there.

Thanks and enjoy,
Adam
